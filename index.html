                particularly noteworthy to see; this group of majestic animals consists of:</p>
            <p>

            <p>South Africa is also known as the ‘Rainbow Nation’, meaning a nation that joins a great variety of
                cultures and languages, all living together as ‘One Nation’.</p>
            <p>It's a country with a rich history, which dates back to some of the earliest human settlements, to the
                first inhabitants, the San, to the Bantu speaking tribes and more recent the European integration in the
                country. Various sites can be visited to see and experience the different stages of history. For
                example, the Battlefields, the Cradle of Humankind, the Bushman rock paintings, various cultural
                villages and places of more recent history such as Soweto and Robben Island.</p>

            <p>Wine-buff visitors head straight to the Western Cape, South Africa's viticultural heartland. With nearly
                all of the country's wine production concentrated in this one area, all you need to do is hire a car (or
                driver) and start exploring. The most famous regions are Paarl, Stellenbosch and Constantia, all a short
                drive from downtown Cape Town.</p>
            <p>A little further afield is Franschhoek, where the restaurants are as acclaimed as the wine. Top wineries
                to visit include the historic Vergelegen, the biodynamic/organic Waterkloof, and Fairview, the home of
                one of South Africa's leading wine brands. Historically, South African wine production focused almost
                entirely on white varieties. But these days the Cape is known for superb red wines too, many of them
                produced using South Africa's “own” grape variety, pinotage.</p>

            <header id="amazing-cape-town-header">Amazing Cape Town</header>
            <p>In any list of the world's most beautifully situated cities, Cape Town always comes out near the top. Set
                on a peninsula beneath the magnificent Table Mountain, Cape Town has great restaurants, fascinating
                culture and spectacular scenery, including multiple gorgeous beaches. Since 1929s, the Table Mountain
                Cableway has been safely transporting visitors to the top of the mountain.</p>
            <p>The view from the top is an unarguable Cape Town must-do, as is a trip to Robben Island, the prison where
                Nelson Mandela was held for 18 of his 27 years in captivity. The V&A Waterfront is a huge retail and
                hospitality precinct, built on the site of Cape Town's former docklands. Already the most visited site
                in Africa, the V&A Waterfront will get another boost next year with the opening of Zeitz MOCAA, Africa's
                first major contemporary art museum.</p>

            <p>Beyond the allure of safaris in Kruger National Park and other parks like Madikwe Game Reserve, there are
                adventures-of-a-lifetime for all tastes. The Garden Route runs from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth, with
                excellent whale watching on the way at Gansbaii. Nearby Cape Town, Seal Island offers great white shark
                viewing by boat.</p>
            <p>For a little bit of everything, try a stay at Bushmans Kloof Wilderness a wilderness getaway for the
                whole family where you can enjoy game drives, hiking, biking, canoeing, and explore 130 unique Bushman
                rock art sites, some dating back 10,000 years.</p>
